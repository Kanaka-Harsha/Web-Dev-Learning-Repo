    <button id="light">Light Theme</button>

    <script src="script.js"></script>

</html>



<!- 
now I have made the html in such a way that when I click the dark theme button, it will call the javascript, where I have kept the javascript in such a way that it changes the css of the html file. by turning the entire page into the opp. colors.

The CSS file, i used two classes(no need to declare in any file before-hand) called as darkth-dark theme, lightth-light theme.


CHanged the css in js accordingly.
